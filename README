phidget-servo-driver
====================

This is just a quick wrap up for driving a phidget servo. This code comes from a number of places 
and there are varied licenses on all of it. It is just collected here for simplicity.

I claim no license. Anything I have added is public domain.

The main servo.c code came from here http://www.phidgets.com/phorum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2093&start=15
where Mike_S is a serious all-star.

You may need to change the hardcoded product id (0x39) to match your phidget:

1) unplug the usb cable
2) reboot your router
3) dmesg -c
4) plug in the usb servo
5) dmesg

This should give you the info you need. If nothing shows up then the Servo is not being picked up and you have a different problem. I toyed around some and made a quick video... your code is awesome :)

Here is a video showing what you can do once you have this working:
